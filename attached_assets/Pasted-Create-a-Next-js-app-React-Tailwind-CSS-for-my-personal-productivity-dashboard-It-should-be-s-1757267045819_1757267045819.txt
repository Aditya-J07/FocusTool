Create a Next.js app (React + Tailwind CSS) for my personal productivity dashboard. 
It should be simple, focus-oriented, and motivational. 
The features I need:

1. Notification Bar
   - Green if all tasks for today are completed.
   - Red if any task is pending.

2. LeetCode Auto-Tracker
   - Use my username: "Aditya_J07".
   - Add a Next.js API route (/api/leetcode) that fetches my stats from https://leetcode.com/graphql.
   - Show how many problems I solved today.
   - Show my current daily streak.
   - Mark daily target as "2 problems by default".

3. YouTube Playlist Tracker
   - Default playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgUwDviBIf0oF6QL8m22w1hIDC1vJ_BHz
   - Embed this playlist in the site.
   - Also create a checklist of videos (based on video titles if possible, else manual).
   - Save my progress in localStorage.

4. Pomodoro Timer
   - 25 min focus / 5 min break cycle by default, adjustable.
   - Start/Stop/Reset buttons.
   - Fullscreen "focus mode" that hides all other UI when running.
   - Play a soft alert sound when the timer finishes.

5. Music Player
   - Preload a few focus tracks (like lo-fi, piano, coding music).
   - Add "Play Random" button to play a random track.
   - Place player at bottom of the site, always visible.

6. Gamification
   - Earn XP for tasks (1 XP per LeetCode Q, 2 XP per video watched, 5 XP for completing all daily tasks).
   - Level up system with titles (e.g., "Level 3 â€“ Consistency Ninja").
   - Show streak flames ðŸ”¥ for consecutive daily completions.
   - Unlock new random songs when I hit milestones.

7. Dashboard
   - Show daily summary: problems solved, videos watched, pomodoro sessions completed.
   - Weekly streak chart (like GitHub contribution graph).
   - Current XP and Level.

8. Motivation
   - Show a random motivational quote at the top of dashboard.
   - Rotate from a small hardcoded list.

Requirements:
- Use Next.js (so I can deploy directly on Vercel).
- Save user progress in localStorage so it persists after refresh.
- Keep code modular: components for Timer, PlaylistTracker, LeetCodeTracker, MusicPlayer, Dashboard.
- Style with Tailwind CSS (minimal, clean, focus-oriented).
